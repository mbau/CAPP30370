			<h3>Golf</h3>
			<p>The Broadmoor's East Course is known for its wide, tree-lined fairways and expansive greens. With its challenging terrain and amazing mountain vistas, The East Course is ranked among the best golf courses in the country. Since the large trees can alter your shots and the putting greens difficult to read, the best tip we can offer for those taking on this open course is to remember that putts break away from the mountains.</p>
			<p>The West Course plays tighter off the tee, with more heavily tree-lined holes than the East Course, and also gives players an array of spectacular approach shots. Don't let the stunning mountain views distract you; our West Course may look like a postcard, but it offers a very challenging and rewarding round of golf.</p>
			<p>After undergoing renovations by Nicklaus Design, the Mountain Course was reopened in July 2006 and plays to a maximum of 7,700 yards, par 72. This beautifully designed course features wide, forgiving fairways and large greens with beautiful mountain vistas, ideal for a range of skill levels and handicaps.</p>

			<h3>Pool</h3>
			<p>As the summer sun begins to warm the Rockies, the graduated edge of our heated, "zero-entry" infinity pool offers a refreshing escape, complete with stunning views of Cheyenne Lake and the mountains. An easily accessible, beach-like sensation invites relaxation, while two water slides provide endless excitement for the entire family. Soak up some rays on the expansive pool deck or lease a private cabana and savor an array of refreshments from our poolside café.</p>
			<p>Guests enjoy complimentary, seasonal access to our lakefront pool along with complete locker facilities, two 14-person outdoor whirlpools and a children's wading pool overlooking the lake and Cheyenne Mountain.</p>

			<h3>Tennis</h3>
			<p>Rated as one of the Top 10 tennis resorts in the country by Tennis Magazine for the past 15 years, The Broadmoor Tennis Club has become legendary in Colorado Springs. Our award-winning tennis facilities include four new cushioned hard courts and two new Har-Tru courts. Two of the hard courts are covered by an illuminated, heated bubble during the winter months, allowing for year-round enjoyment.</p>
			<p>Whether you are interested in challenging friends or colleagues to a match, hosting a tennis tournament for your organization, or brushing up on your skills with our knowledgeable Tennis Pros, The Broadmoor offers the ultimate Colorado Springs tennis experience.</p>
